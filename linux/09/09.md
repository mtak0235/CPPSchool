# Homework #9 

1. Start a terminal, and do “hostname”, then do “su” (password is required), then do “hostname testhost”, then do “hostname”, then do “domainname”, then do “domainname jnu.ac.kr”, then do “domainname”, then do “exit”

-  If you start a new terminal what is changed? 
  변경했던 hostname과 domainname이 다시 원상복구되었다.
- If you restart the machine and start a new terminal, is still the change of host and domain name valid?

2. do “clear”, then do “ifconfig” (you may install net-tools “sudo apt-get install net-tools”), then check the name of the network interface card name from the result

In this example, “ens33” is the name of the network interface card. Then do “su”(password is required), then do “ifconfig ens33 down” (wait for around 5 seconds, if the name of your network interface card is different, use it rather than “ens33”), then do “ifconfig ens33”, then do “ifconfig ens33 up”(wait for around 5 seconds), then do “ifconfig ens33”

- What is IP address, subnet mask, MAC address (ether) of your network interface card? ( If there is no “ens33” device, please find the name of your network interface card and use the device name)
  ip : 172.16.81.130
  subnet mask : 255.255.255.0

  mac address: 00:0c:29:50:40:0c

3. In this exercise, you are going to add a new gateway and routing table. The following commands are based on the assumption that your network is 192.168.237.0/24. In this example, the new gateway is 192.168.237.3 and the new network is 192.168.238.0/24. If your network is different, use your network address for setting gateway address and subnet address by using the similar subnet prefix of your network.

Do “clear”, then do “route”, then do “route –n”, then do “route add default gw 192.168.237.3”, then do “route”, then do “route –n”, then do “route add –net 192.168.238.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.237.3” then do “route”, then do “route –n” (Here we assume that the IPv4 address of the basic NIC is 192.168.237.128/24. If you have different subnet, please use the same subnet prefix for setting default gateway. e.g. subnet : 192.168.142.*, possible gateway IPv4 address : 192.168.142.3, 192.168.142.4, and so on, possible other network 192.168.143.0/24, 192.168.144.0/24 and so on)

- What is the meaning of “route add –net 192.168.238.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.237.3”? 
- `route add`: 경로 추가를 지정하는 명령어입니다.
- `-net 192.168.238.0`: 목적지 IP 네트워크를 192.168.238.0으로 지정합니다.
- `netmask 255.255.255.0`: 서브넷 마스크를 255.255.255.0으로 지정합니다. 이는 192.168.238.0 네트워크의 서브넷 마스크를 나타냅니다.
- `gw 192.168.237.3`: 게이트웨이로 192.168.237.3을 지정합니다. 이는 목적지 네트워크로 전송되는 패킷을 처리하는 라우터의 IP 주소입니다.

즉, 이 명령어는 192.168.238.0 네트워크에 대한 패킷이 192.168.237.3을 통해 전송되도록 라우팅 테이블에 항목을 추가합니다.

- What is the command to remove the policies which are added in this exercise?
  route del -net 192.168.238.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 172.16.81.3

4. Do “apt-get install openssh-server”, then do “netstat –ntl”. Do “ssh peterpan@127.0.0.1” (here we assume that this machine has an user “peterpan”. For the first question please press “yes”, then provide password for the user peterpan). Then, do “whoami”, then do “id”, then do “exit”.

5. Do “apt-get install apache2”, then start a firefox browser, and type “http://127.0.0.1” in the address bar, then type “http://127.0.0.1/~peterpan” in the address bar. 

   - Take a screenshot of firefox browser for both cases

     Back to the terminal and do “ls /etc/apache2/mods-enabled”, then do “ln –s /etc/apache2/modsavailable/userdir.load /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.load”, then do “ln –s /etc/apache2/modsavailable/userdir.conf /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/userdir.conf”, then do “service apache2 restart”, then do “su peterpan”(we assume that we have a user “peterpan”), then do “cd ~”, then do “mkdir public_html”, then do “touch public_html/index.html”, then add the contents of index.html as follows:

```html
<html><body><h1>Linux System Testing</h1>
<h1>JNU Linux System Exercise Page</h1>
<p>This is the test web page of user.</p>
<p>The web server software is running but no content has been added, yet.</p>
</body></html>
```

Then, do “chmod 755 ~/public_html”, then do “chmod 644 ~/public_html/index.html”. Then, in the firefox browser, type “http://127.0.0.1/~peterpan” in the address bar.

6. For accessing ssh server and web server from outside of the virtual machine. ## Virtual box case You need to set up port forwarding rules. Set two forwarding rules as follows:

<img width="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mtak0235/hw/assets/48946398/53c95cb3-7af3-469a-9270-839b74b1337c">

After setting these rules, try to access ssh server and web server as follows: 1) ssh server : start any ssh client (cmd for windows, putty and so on), then type “ssh –p 10022 peterpan@127.0.0.1” 2) web server : type “http://127.0.0.1:20080” or “http://127.0.0.1:20080/~peterpan” in the address bar of chrome or edge (or other web browser)

\# VMware Workstation case 

1) Check the network setting as NAT

 Click the menu : Player -> Manage -> Virtual Machine Setting

After checking this setting and finding the IP address of the network interface card (in this example, IP of NIC is 192.168.237.128, try to access ssh server and web server as follows: 

1) ssh server : start any ssh client (cmd for windows, putty and so on), then type “ssh peterpan@192.168.237.128”
2)  web server : type “http://192.168.237.128” or “http://192.168.237.128/~peterpan” in the address bar of chrome or edge (or other web browser)
